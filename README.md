# Advanced Data Analytics Project

Welcome to my Advanced Data Analytics Project! This repository showcases comprehensive data analysis using modern analytical techniques, SQL, Python, and data visualization tools to derive actionable business insights from complex datasets.

## Project Background

This project demonstrates advanced data analytics capabilities through end-to-end analysis of business data. As a data analyst working with enterprise-level datasets, this project focuses on extracting meaningful insights from large, complex data structures to support strategic business decisions. The analysis covers multiple business domains including customer behavior, operational efficiency, financial performance, and market trends.

The project leverages modern data analytics tools and methodologies to process, analyze, and visualize data, providing stakeholders with clear, actionable recommendations based on statistical analysis and predictive modeling.

**Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:**

- **Customer Analytics:** Customer segmentation, behavior patterns, and lifetime value analysis
- **Operational Performance:** Process efficiency, resource utilization, and performance metrics
- **Financial Analysis:** Revenue trends, cost optimization, and profitability assessment  
- **Market Intelligence:** Competitive analysis, market trends, and growth opportunities

The SQL queries used to inspect and clean the data for this analysis and 
Targeted SQL queries regarding various business questions can be found in Scripts Folder in the Repo 



## Data Structure & Initial Checks

The main database structure consists of multiple interconnected tables with comprehensive business data, totaling over 100,000 records. A description of each key table is as follows:

**Customer Table:** Contains customer demographics, registration dates, and account information with 25,000+ customer records.

**Transaction Table:** Stores all transaction data including purchase amounts, dates, product categories, and payment methods with 75,000+ transaction records.

**Product Table:** Product catalog with pricing, categories, inventory levels, and performance metrics for 5,000+ products.

**Analytics Table:** Aggregated metrics and calculated fields for reporting and analysis purposes with pre-computed KPIs.

## Assumptions and Caveats

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

**Data Quality Assumption:** Missing customer demographic data (8% of records) was imputed using statistical methods based on transaction patterns and geographic data, which may introduce minor variations in segmentation analysis.

**Seasonal Adjustment:** Analysis assumes historical seasonal patterns will continue, though external market factors and economic conditions may influence future trends differently than past performance.

**Technology Implementation:** ROI calculations assume successful implementation of recommended technology solutions within projected timelines, though implementation risks and change management factors may affect actual returns.

**Market Conditions:** Competitive analysis assumes current market structure remains stable, though industry disruption or new market entrants could impact growth projections and strategic recommendations.

**Data Timeframe:** Analysis covers 24-month historical period and may not fully account for recent market shifts or emerging trends that could influence future performance metrics.
